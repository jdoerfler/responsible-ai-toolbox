This is a record of all past rAI-toolbox releases and what went into them, in reverse

This is a pre-release. You can install it with:

This is rAI-toolbox's first stable release on PyPI! Please check out the rest of our 
docs to see what the toolbox has to offer.

We plan to have an aggressive release schedule for compatibility-preserving patches of 
bug-fixes and quality-of-life improvements (e.g. improved type annotations), and to 
regularly add features. Experimental parts of the toolbox's API that may undergo 
significant changes in future releases are documented as such.
